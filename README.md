## About the Project

Apparel manufacturing process involves different types of operations thus requiring different machines to produce different styles of garments from different types of fabrics. Owing to the increasing competitiveness manufacturers are continuously striving for improving efficiency on the sewing floor. This calls for full proof of machine understanding, material feeding, and maintenance of the machines  to avoid loss due to machine breakdown or machine malfunctioning. This project would aim at developing an interactive guide through an AR platform to learn the machine's part details, material feeding mechanism and maintenance procedure by virtually handling the machine parts, dismantling it and assembling back again as would be required in the real scenario during various maintenance. This will have different modules for different machines. This will be in augmented form for personnel to have immersive experience. The proposed number of machines will be 5-6 e.g. SNLS, DNLS, Fusing Machine, Automatic Fabric Cutting machine etc.
